<h3 align="center">The Emperor's New Clothes</h3>
<p><span style="font-style:italic">Far away, in a time long past,</span> there lived a <b>traveling tailor</b> who found himself in an unfamiliar country. How, tailors who move from place to place normally keep to themselves and are careful not to overstep the bounds of local decency. This tailor, though, was overly gregarious and decorum-impaired, and soon he was at a local inn, abusing alcohol, invading the personal space of the female employees, and telling unenlightened stories about tinkers, dung-gatherers, and other tradespeople.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <i>innkeeper</i> complained to the <big>police</big>, who grabbed the tailor and dragged him in front of the emperor. As you might expect, a lifetime of belief in the absolute legitimacy of the <small>monarchy</small> and in the inherent superiority of males had turned the emperor into a vain and wisdom-challenged tyrant. The tailor noticed these traits and decided to use them to his advantage. The <em>emperor</em> asked,<strong>"Do you have any last requests before I banish you from my domain forever?"</strong> The <span style="text-decoration:underline">tailor replied</span>,<cite>"Only that your majesty allow me the honor of crafting a new <span style="font-weight:bolder">royal wardrobe</span>. For I have brought with me a special fabric that is so rate and fine that it can be seen only by certain people-- they type of people you'd want to have in your realm -- people who are politically correct, morally righteous, intellectually astute, culturally tolerant, and who don't smoke, drink, laugh at sexist jokes, watch too much television, listen to country music, or barbecue."</cite></p>
<hr />
After a <span style="font-size:x-large">moment's thought</span> , the <u>emperor</u> agreed to this request. He was flattered by the fascist and testosterone-heavy idea that the empire and its inhabitants existed only to make him look good. Of course, no such rarefied fabric existed. Years of living outside the bounds of normal society had forced the tailor to develop his own moral code that obliged him to swindle and embarrass the emperor in the name of independent craftspeople everywhere. -- by James Fin Gardner in Politically Correct Bedtime Stories--
