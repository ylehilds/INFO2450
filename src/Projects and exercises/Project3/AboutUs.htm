			Ted and Betty Russon have been happily married for 30 years.  They look back on their honeymoon at 			Arches National Monument with great fondness.  They have tried to keep the same spice in their 				marriage as they found on their honeymoon.  This amazing couple make it a practice to try out new 			extreme sports together, just for the fun of it.  Their own honeymoon consisted of a wild mountain 			biking adventure in the beautiful slick red rock near Moab, Utah and through Arches National 				Monument. On this same trip they also spent 3 days white water rafting down the Colorado River.
