The Emperor's New Clothes
Far away, in a time long past, there lived a traveling tailor 
who found himself in an unfamiliar country.  How, tailors who 
move from place to place normally keep to themselves and are 
careful not to overstep the bounds of local decency.  This tailor, 
though, was overly gregarious and decorum-impaired, and soon he 
was at a local inn, abusing alcohol, invading the personal space 
of the female employees, and telling unenlightened stories about 
tinkers, dung-gatherers, and other tradespeople. 
The innkeeper complained to the police, who grabbed the tailor and 
dragged him in front of the emperor. As you might expect, a lifetime 
of belief in the absolute legitimacy of the monarchy and in the 
inherent superiority of males had turned the emperor into a vain 
and wisdom-challenged tyrant.  The tailor noticed these traits and 
decided to use them to his advantage.
The emperor asked,"Do you have any last requests before I banish 
you from my domain forever?"
The tailor replied,"Only that your majesty allow me the honor of 
crafting a new royal wardrobe.  For I have brought with me a special 
fabric that is so rate and fine that it can be seen only by certain 
people-- they type of people you'd want to have in your realm -- people 
who are politically correct, morally righteous, intellectually astute, 
culturally tolerant, and who don't smoke, drink, laugh at sexist jokes, 
watch too much television, listen to country music, or barbecue."
After a moment's thought, the emperor agreed to this request.  
He was flattered by the fascist and testosterone-heavy idea that the 
empire and its inhabitants existed only to make him look good.  Of course, 
no such rarefied fabric existed.  Years of living outside the bounds of 
normal society had forced the tailor to develop his own moral code that 
obliged him to swindle and embarrass the emperor in the name of independent 
craftspeople everywhere.
