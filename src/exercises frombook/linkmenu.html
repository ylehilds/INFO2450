<h1> Really Honest Book Reviews </h1>
<p> I read a lot of books about manu different subjects. Though I'm not a book critic
, and I don;t do this for a living, I enjoy a really good read every now and then
. Here's a list of books that I've read recently:</p>

<ul>

<li><i> <a href="rainbow.html">The Rainbow Returns</i> by E. Smith </a>. A fantasy story set in biblical times. Slow at times, but interesting.</li>
<li><i> <a href="wealth.html">Seven Steps To Imesurable Wealth</i> by R. U. Needy </a>. I'm still poor, but I'm happy! And that's the whole point.</li>
<li><i> <a href="food.html">The Food-Lovers Guide to Weight Loss</i> by L. Goode </a>. At last! A diet book with recipes that taste good!</li>
<li><i> <a href="silly.html">The Silly Person's Guide to Seriousness</i> by M. Nott</a>. Come on ... who wants to be serious?</li>

</ul>
