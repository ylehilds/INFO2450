    <dt>Macbeth</dt>
    <dd>I'll go no more. I am afraid to think of
    what I have done; look on't again I dare not.</dd>
    <dt>Lady Macbeth</dt>
    <dd>Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers.
    The sleeping and the dead are as but pictures. 'Tis the eye
    if childhood that fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I'll
    gild the faces if the grooms withal, for it must seem their
    guilt. (Exit. Knocking within)</dd>
    <dt>Macbeth</dt>
    <dd>Whence is that knocking? How is't wit me when
    every noise apalls me? What hands are here? Ha! They pluck out
    mine eyes! Will all Neptuneâ€™s ocean wash this blood clean from
    my hand? No. This my hand will rather the multitudinous seas
    incarnadine, making the green one red. (Enter Lady Macbeth)</dd>
    <dt>Lady Macbeth</dt>
    <dd>My hands are of your color, but I shame to
    wear a heart so white.</dd>
