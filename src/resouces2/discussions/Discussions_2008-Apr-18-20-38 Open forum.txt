Subject: Web Developer job market!		Author: Lehi Alcantara

I was wondering how was the market for web developers here in Orem-Provo area. I&#39;m looking to get a new job that would pay considerably good compared to the telemarketing and customer services jobs out there available for students. <br/><br/>How or where can I find those jobs nearby&#63; Any suggestions&#63; Referrals if you work as a web developer already would be appreciated as well. <br/>I know I’m just starting with XHTML, and it might be the case of some students taking this class as well, but from what I hear to start a job with employers or companies, you don’t need as much experience as a web developer to start; otherwise I would be asking too much money for my knowledge, and they usually don’t like to pay as much to start, am I right&#63; If no, after XHTML what would be a good subject for me to learn next&#63; I was just thinking about finishing up the textbook we have since I’m acquainted with the material and it is a good book, supposedly the author also teaches javascript, dhtml, php, and etc on later chapters as well.<br/>Any help would be appreciated, thanks and have a nice day everyone!<br/>

Lehi,<br/>Patti Miner, the IS&amp;T department advisor regularly emails out job notices to our students, many of which are web development jobs.<br/>I don&#39;t know if these are aggregated anywhere, but you can email her at minerpa@uvsc.edu.<br/>Kim
