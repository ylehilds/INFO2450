Subject: Are we graphic designers?		Author: Kimberly Bartholomew

Dear Students,<br/><br/>While we may not be artists or graphic designers, there are many artistic or aesthetic considerations that should be part of web design. It would be great to work in a large company where they had artists and graphic designers on staff to work in our team, but in reality, most web designers work alone or within a small company and are expected to provide their clients with well designed web sites.<br/><br/>In a graphic design program of study they have the luxury of being able to offer entire courses in typography, color theory and composition. In this course, we have tried to incorporate some of these topics along with the technical aspects of web design. <br/><br/>Some knowledge can be a dangerous thing. A web designer wields many font styles, font-families, color, and images and soon we will add other graphical elements. <br/><br/>While we talk about these in isolation, when they are brought together into a site design, they must work together. <br/><br/>What strategies can we use to upgrade the design aspects of our own web design&#63;<br/>How does the target audience or client play a role in web design&#63;<br/>How might the saying, &quot;Just because you can, does not mean you should&quot; apply to web design&#63;<br/><br/>Please share your opinions on these topics.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Kim<br/><br/>

I was looking around for some good information on web site design.  I found a pretty cool site that gives some ideas on how to improve the design of your site:<br/><br/>http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/process.cfm<br/><br/>It has some links to different design help sections.  Not all of it has to do with graphic design, but I found the information helpful.<br/><br/>One of the sections talks about using simplicity in your design. He encourages &#39;creating simple designs&#39;.

Michael,<br/>Thanks for this link.<br/>I totally agree that too often simplicity in design is ignored in favor for flashy and often unusable, unusual design.<br/>Too often there is little use of white space or unused space that allows a site to be more readable.<br/>Another benefit of a more simple design is that is will usually not have viewing problems in multiple browsers.<br/>Kim<br/>

I agree with Michael on the simplicity aspect of design.   I took a design class way back in the 80&#39;s and we studied the design principles of Bauhaus.  I wondered if any one had tried to apply these principles to web design.  As I did my Goggle search I found many who claimed that they did.  So far I have not found one that is my ideal of Bauhaus simplicity and functionality.  Clients have a hard time seeing that less can be more.  Their ideal may not be mine.  I think that you listen and try to stylize what they want and make sure that the layout flows and you can read it and find the information that you are looking for easily.  If you accomplish that then at least you met the functionality portion of design the other is all in the eye of the beholder.

I don&#39;t think that web developers should be graphic designers. I would admit that there are a subset of people out there who may be able to do very well at both jobs, but I feel that is the exception and not the rule. Developers (even web developers) tend to need tight organizational habits. They need to be analytical thinkers. In my experience, graphic designers (and other marketing positions) are more free thinkers. They fall apart when having to dive into lots of details and want to stay higher level. It&#39;s hard to be lower level than the code itself.<br/><br/>I would agree that in a smaller company, you may wear many hats, but I think that goes along with &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;. My experience has also shown that developers tend to be (for obvious reasons) more computer literate than say your graphics designers. Even though a graphics designer may work on a computer all day, most don&#39;t know the ins and outs like a developer would. That relates to how you view your target audience. I am constantly amazed at the things our marketing department comes up with as far as customer communication. Most of the time, I find myself saying, &quot;There is no way this would make me want to buy this&quot; or, &quot;Doesn&#39;t everyone already know this&#63;&quot;.<br/><br/>So I feel that a developer, designing a website, would miss things which will cause the site to be ill-received by the general public, simply because they don&#39;t think the same way.

We shouldn&#39;t be graphic designers I think there should be people designated for the graphics part and have the web designers take care of the web side of it.  But I do agree on what everyone is saying every web page should be simple and clean and not clutter the web page.  It should be easy to navigate and easy to access information that is needed.  But leave it to the artist and graphic people to take care of the graphics part of the web page.

Subject: If not we sure wear that hat alot.		Author: Matthew Thompson

The majority of the websites that I have created, I have had to do graphics works. These websites are on a very small scale, but people expect a professional look and feel. One of the biggest things is consistency through out the site. In high school the thing that bugged me the most about our schools website is that at different times students were given certain pieces of the site to work on and so when you viewed the different pages within the site each page was different. Even the logo used would be different. Anytime I design a website, I always use a template. This is either one that I have built from scratch or purchased. I then just change out the headings and content. This ensures that all the pages are identical in look and feel.

Matt,<br/>I agree that templates can help create a consistent look and feel for a web site.  The project management part of an entire website may be beyond an individual, but we can still try to be advocates for consistency.  This not only goes toward a more usable web site, but can greatly increase the productivity of site creation.<br/>Kim<br/><br/>P.S. We will make use of templates in project 7 and 8!

There is no hurt to study more. As web designers, it will make us stronger if we know graphic design. <br/>Depend on people&#39;s opinion, some like design webs but don&#39;t like graphic design and vice versa. However, in my opinion, if I am a web definer, I would spend time on study graphic design.<br/>

This question reminds me of my brother-in-law who does auto-body work for a living. His expertise is painting, dent and collision repair. However, because he &#39;works on cars&#39;, people ask him to fix their mechanical problems, such as engines, transmissions and such. While he is pretty competent mechanically, it&#39;s not really what he knows. So, while body work is certainly related to mechanical work, and part of the same finished product, they are not necesarily two things you want the same person doing for you.<br/><br/>I see the graphic design and web design/programming relationship the same way. You might find a graphic designer who can do web programming, or a web programmer who can do graphic design, but do you really want the same person doing both&#63; My experience has been that when you ask for a generalist, you get a generally decent product, but if you ask for a specialist, you get a great product. Ultimately it is more expensive, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.<br/><br/>As for the questions, I think the best thing we can do to upgrade our own web designing is to copy the designs of those great sites. I don&#39;t mean to plagiarize or copy code, just that choosing a similar layout or scheme to a really great site will help your site to be closer to the great side than the mediocre side.<br/><br/>The targe audience should play a huge role in how a site is designed. MySpace is a good example of this, it&#39;s for kids with short attention spans who want lots going on, and that&#39;s exactly what they get. If I went to a business site that had that kind of layout, I&#39;d never patronize them just for that, regardless of how their product measured up. I think MySpace is also a good example of the phrase about doing things just because you can. How many MySpace pages have stupid annoying widgets and gadgets on them, just because they can and not for any real design reason&#63; Most, in my opinion. Then again, I&#39;m an old guy and hardly the target audience!

Thats funny that you write about the mechanic/autobody thing.  My wife got sideswiped once and the place the insurance company took it to did an awsome job with the body work.  I was totally impressed.  Then I had to take the car back in to them multiple times because the suspension system was totally messed up and they were not very good at the &quot;guts&quot; of the car I guess.  After that I wasn&#39;t so impressed.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is:<br/><br/>I will let other people do the graphic work if I decide to design any websites in the future.  There have been times in the past when I will walk out to go somewhere and my wife will just start laughing at me and ask me if I am seriously gonna wear that combination out in public.

I can&#39;t agree with you any more Curt.  First I like the analogy of the body shop worker.  The same can be said about a web design team.  Where I work we have a team of 6-7 people that include a graphic artist, several of code monkeys, and a search engine optimizer.  All of these people are very skilled at their jobs, especially our SEO since lots of our business is done by web traffic driven to our site.<br/><br/>Compare that to some of the freelance work that I do.  I maybe have two years of basic web experience, a year of photoshop/illustrator, and a year of flash.  I am not artistically inclined so I am left at looking at other people&#39;s designs to come with a page layout.  This is the same idea though that you get what you pay for.  Most of the people I do websites for do not have their entire business rely upon their site.  That&#39;s why they can pay a little and now they have a web address they can put on their business cards.<br/><br/>If a company has a heavy reliance upon their website (amazon.com) then it would be wise to have specialized roles in your web department so a professional site can be created and maintained.  If a company is looking for a web presence (construction company) then hiring one guy or outsourcing the work to a company would be a better option since the life blood of your company isn&#39;t dependent upon your website.<br/><br/>Either way you will always get what you pay for which means paying multiple people that have specialized roles will almost always get you a better site then paying one person with general experience.

I think that it is good to know a little bit of everything it might be helpful at some point in our career. What I am trying to say is that we don&#39;t necessarily need to be web designer. But we can contribute to the them with our ideas. Everyone has an ability and the most important here i think is to be open to create something unique for the customer.

i think a lot of times in websites less is more. just because you can add a lot of fancy .gifs or flash images doesn&#39;t mean you should. Try to keep people from getting lost, I think a webpage should be functional before it is pretty.

I have always liked the less is more approach. When I am out surfing the web, I do not want to see lots of flashing animation or unnecessary images. I want to see what I am looking for. Too much stuff on a web page is likely to drive me away with its pointlessness. Web designers must have a basic understanding of art they must know what looks good so the page looks better than a three year old art project (kind of like my page).<br/>Your target audience is a huge factor in how you design your site. Kids want a bunch of moving and flashy objects to interact with. But the interaction must be simple. Teens seem to want darker color but still want the entertainment, while adults want information fast. The point is if it is your site and something is not right who is going to get yelled at for it, the guy who made the images or the guy who put it on the company site&#63;<br/>

in my opinion knowledge about how to do different things are helpfull so that you will have many tools to use, but just like the saying &quot;Just because you can, does not mean you should&quot; it doesn&#39;t necessarily means that we should use everything we know in our web site to try different methods to know what is the best way of implementing your web site is good in my opinion untill you find what works the best for your web site. I agree that keeping it simple is the best just because it is straight forward and easy to navigate. the target for the web site plays an important role because we want to make sure they feel comfortable navigating the web site, if that&#39;s a businees web site that&#39;s fundamental since they will be paying for your services.

I think that when designing a website one of the best things you can do is look at other sites that are similar to what you&#39;re doing and get ideas from them.  Sometimes these other companies may have spent good money on design, and you can learn a thing or two from that.<br/><br/>Also, it&#39;s important to know your limitations.  Know what you&#39;re good at, and maybe outsource what you&#39;re not as good with.

Tough call. I often find myself wondering what the heck I think I&#39;m doing when trying to create a graphic. Simple because, I&#39;m not artist. <br/><br/>Of course web design is something not to be overlooked. Thats what your visitors, clients, audience or whoever will be looking at every time they visit your site. You want to attract them, not drive them away. <br/><br/><br/>An interesting site I found that has some neat things....<br/>http://www.digitalthread.com/

I know that as I have worked with the website designers at uvsc for aviation that it designing a website for looks is just as important as having a functional website.  Just like a book or a movie you want to keep people interested in what they ware looking at.  And with an even more increasing market and competition becoming more fierce this becomes even more important.

Some of the main things that i think about whenever i am about to start designing a new page is the look that i am going for.  if i dont have an idea right from the start as to what i am looking for then i seem to get lost while making it and everything seems a lot harder to do.  this would be the same with making it for someone else.  i would need them to give me an idea that would guide me to what the client is looking for.<br/>Even though there are alot of people that know how to design a web site not very many of them actually will go in that direction.  while they know how to create them they dont necessarily have the artistic abilities and vision that is required when you are doing projects of this sort.  so while i think that you have to be knowledgeable about HTML coding to create the web sites you also need to have an artistic side to you to make the design and look to be above the rest.
