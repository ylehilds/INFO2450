<h1 align="center" style="color: maroon"> Web Site Evaluations </h1>
	<h2 style="color: SeaGreen"> The Purpose of this Web site is to evaluate the web design of 3 distinctive web sites. </h2>
		<h3  style="color: gray"> Bellow, there are 10 questions that I will answer for each web site, for web design evaluation purposes:</h3>
<ol>
	<li> What was your first impression of this site? </li>
	<li> How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?) </li>
	<li> Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why? </li>
	<li> Does the graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why? </li>
	<li> How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable? </li>
	<li> Was the text color and size readable?  If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
	<li> Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool?  Was the navigation well done?</li>
	<li> Did the links used on this site allow for easy forward and backward navigation?</li>
	<li> Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</li>
	<li> What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done? </li>
</ol>

	<h2 align="center" style="color: blue"> Evaluating Web Site: <a href="http://www.rythospital.com/nanodocs/" target="_blank"> www.rythospital.com/nanodocs </a> </h2>
<ol>
	<li> My first impression was that Technology has come long ways to help out health issues.</li>
	<li> The web site had links mostly on the middle center of page. Also had some pictures of their product.</li>
	<li> The site structure makes sense to me, because it is straight forward on what they want users to see.</li>
	<li> The graphics really enhance the site because it gives the users the images of the NANODOCS.</li>
	<li> The page loaded reasonably fast, without any delay.</li>
	<li> The text was colored and the size was readable, some links on the middle top of site had colored background, that made the text not very readable.</li>
	<li> The site had a navigation bar on the right hand side that helped to navigate it. besides the bar there were links to jump to different pages.</li>
	<li> Yes the links really made the site easy to jump pages, either forward or backwards easily.</li>
	<li> Yes, The technology look and feel was repeated on all pages.</li>
	<li> The site offers different and interesting information that is unusual and hard to believe (for example: male pregnancy).</li>
</ol>

	<h2 align="center" style="color: green"> Evaluating Web Site: <a href="http://www.hl2.com/" target="_blank"> www.hl2.com </a> </h2>
<ol>
	<li> My first impression of this site was that it was very dynamic and interactive as pertaining to users.</li>
	<li> The site organizes information interactively, meaning whatever you are interested in and click, that's the only information you will get. They had links with an image.</li>
	<li> At first it confused me because of the simplicity. After playing around with it, it made complete sense.</li>
	<li> The graphics definitely enhances the web site, because it gives a feel of interaction.</li>
	<li> The web site took quite a while to load in my opinion. I think that was due to the animation going on. If you have a slow computer that may bother users, due to taking too long to load a page. </li>
	<li> The text was colored in black, which it suits well since the whole background was white.</li>
	<li> The site did not have a navigation bar, but it did have an image that you can interact with. The only information you see is what you request.</li>
	<li> Yes, The web site links to go forward or backward was very easy and efficient.</li>
	<li> Yes, With the white background and black color text. That was repeated through the whole web site.</li>
	<li> This web site was very well done, because of the well interaction between the site and its users.</li>
